# Password Management

--

## Definitions

- Clear Text
  - the transmission or storage of unencrypted data
  - This is **not** equivalent to Plain Text

--
## So why is it so detrimental when a particular site's user credentials are leaked?

--

## I keep hearing about hashed passwords being leaked *on the line*. What the hell is *password hashing*?

A `hash` is an irreversible string derived from an initial string.

## So now that you know what a 'hash' is, how can we apply it to passwords?

In the event that a password database is leaked, hashes help prevent an attacker
from logging in to other websites. If stored normally, a user that uses a
password across multiple sites will be vulnerable if only one of the sites is
compromised.

When a user creates an account, the system stores their account information, but
instead of storing their password on the disk, it runs the password through the
one-way hash function and stores the digest instead.

When a user logins into the system in the future, the system takes the
password that they provide, runs it through the one-way hash function, then
compares it to the existing digest stored for that user.

The system only needs to be able to check if the output from the hash function is the same; it doesn't need to store any details about the password, and it doesn't need to remember the password itself.

## What is password salting?

Even though a hash is one way, an attacker can still figure out which hash
corresponds with certain common passwords using a *rainbow table*.

A rainbow table is a pre-computed mapping of common passwords to their hashed
values. An attacker simply looks up the hash in the table, and finds the password.

One way to defend against this is to add a *salt* to the password before hashing
it. A random string of characters is generated by the server and stored in the
database. By appending this *salt* to the password before hashing, rainbow tables
become infeasible because even commonly used passwords have some element of
random data. The rainbow tables needed to match against salted passwords grows
exponentially as the salt gets longer.

### So what are my options?
- good ol' pen and paper
- multi-platform password managers
- hardware encryption
- curl up into the fetal position

### Password Managers

Password managers typically store passwords encrypted, and require the user to
create a *master password*; a single, ideally very strong password which
encrypts the **entire** password database.

Depending on the manager, data (i.e. credentials) is either stored locally or on *the ominous cloud*.

### Things to considered
- Would I like the ability to access my credentials via mobile or better yet multiple devices?
- Should I self-host?

##### self-hosted solutions

- [Encryptr](https://github.com/SpiderOak/Encryptr)
- [KeePass](http://keepass.info/)
- [Padlock](https://github.com/maklesoft/padlock)

##### offline solutions
- [pass](http://www.passwordstore.org/)

## KeePass

KeePass is an open source password manager that stores passwords in an encrypted
file. The file can be located on an internet-accessible machine to be synced and
used across multiple machines.

### Pros
- Open source, can easily be audited
- Strong encryption based on a passphrase, key file, or both
- Has (unofficial) clients for browser integration (KeeFox) and mobile (Android) and web
- Passwords never have to leave your personal server

### Cons
- Mobile app is not "official"
- No built in browser integration
- For sync, need a server to keep database file on
- Web interface requires the database to be hosted over WebDAV
- Requires Mono for Linux (ewww .NET)

### What About Hardware Encryption

#### Mooltipass
Created by the Hackaday community, the [Mooltipass](https://hackaday.io/project/86-mooltipass)
is an offline password keeper that uses AES-256 encryption.

## Two Factor Authentication

This adds an additional layer of security. When logging in to your account, after
providing your username and password, you will be asked for a two-factor
authentication code that is delivered to your mobile device via SMS or two-factor
application of your choice. This additional step ensures that a malicious person
who has discovered your password will not be able to log in to your account.
