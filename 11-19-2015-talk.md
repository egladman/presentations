# Password Management

--

## Definitions

- Clear Text
  - the transmission or storage of unencrypted data
  - This is **not** equivalent to Plain Text

--
## So why is it so detrimental when a particular site's user credentials are leaked?

--

## I keep hearing about hashed passwords being leaked *on the line*. What the hell is *password hashing*?

A `hash` is an irreversible string derived from an initial string.

## So now that you know what a 'hash' is, how can we apply it to passwords?

<!-- Notes -->
<!-- When a user creates an account, the system stores their account information, but
instead of storing their password on the disk, it runs the password through the
one-way hash function and stores the digest instead. When a user wants to log
in to the system in the future, the system takes the password that they provide,
runs it through the one-way hash function, then compares it to the existing
digest stored for that user. The system only needs to be able to check if the
output from the hash function is the same; it doesn’t need to store any details
about the password, and it doesn’t need to remember the password itself. -->

## What is password salting?

### So what are my options?
- good ol' pen and paper
- multi-platform password managers
- hardware encryption
- curl up into the fetal position

### Password Managers

Password managers typically store passwords encrypted, and require the user to
create a *master password*; a single, ideally very strong password which
encrypts the **entire** password database.

Depending on the manager, data (i.e. credentials) is either stored locally or on *the ominous cloud*.

### Things to considered
- Would I like the ability to access my credentials via mobile or better yet multiple devices?
- Should I self-host?

##### self-hosted solutions
- [Clipperz](https://github.com/clipperz/password-manager)
- [Encryptr](https://github.com/SpiderOak/Encryptr)
- [KeePass](http://keepass.info/)
- [Padlock](https://github.com/maklesoft/padlock)
- [Passopolis](https://github.com/WeAreWizards/passopolis-extensions)
- [RatticDB](https://github.com/tildaslash/RatticWeb)

##### offline solutions
- [pass](http://www.passwordstore.org/)

## KeePass

KeePass is an open source password manager that stores passwords in an encrypted
file. The file can be located on an internet-accessible machine to be synced and
used across multiple machines.

### Pros
- Open source, can easily be audited
- Strong encryption based on a passphrase, key file, or both
- Has (unofficial) clients for browser integration (KeeFox) and mobile (Android) and web
- Passwords never have to leave your personal server

### Cons
- Mobile app is not "official"
- No built in browser integration
- For sync, need a server to keep database file on
- Web interface requires the database to be hosted over WebDAV
- Requires Mono for Linux (ewww .NET)

### What About Hardware Encryption

#### Mooltipass
Created by the Hackaday community, the [Mooltipass](https://hackaday.io/project/86-mooltipass)
is an offline password keeper that uses AES-256 encryption.

## Two Factor Authentication

This adds an additional layer of security. When logging in to your account, after
providing your username and password, you will be asked for a two-factor
authentication code that is delivered to your mobile device via SMS or two-factor
application of your choice. This additional step ensures that a malicious person
who has discovered your password will not be able to log in to your account.
