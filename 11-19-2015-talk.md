# Password Management

--

### So why is it sooo detrimental when a particular site's user credentials are leaked?

--

### I keep hearing about hashed passwords being leaked *on the line*. What the hell is *password hashing*?

### What is password salting?

### So what are my options?
- good ol' pen and paper
- multi-platform password managers
- hardware encryption
- curl up into the fetal position

### Password Managers

Password managers typically store passwords encrypted, and require the user to create a *master password*; a single, ideally very strong password which grants the user access to their **entire** password database.

Depending on the manager, data (i.e. credentials) is either stored locally or on *the ominous cloud*.

### Things to considered
- Would I like the ability to access my credentials via mobile or better yet multiple devices?
- Should I self-host?
