# What is Open Source?
## Free as in Freedom!!

--

### Definition

Open source software is software whose source code is available for modification or enhancement by anyone. This means that anyone should be able to modify the source code to suit his or her needs, and that no one should prevent others from doing the same.

--

### Definition

It’s open! Free for anyone to improve if they choose.
It's ransparent, all commits can be publicly viewed.
It’s a philosophy that encourages sharing and collaboration.
There's Very few barriers to entry.

### How does it Work?

Since anyone can work on a piece of open source software without asking for permission from original authors, fixes, updates and general improvements are prevalent.

Someone might spot and correct errors or omissions that a program's original authors might have missed.

### Open Source vs Proprietary Software
-Bugs are reported and reproduced, so they can be fixed.
-Not so much of an initiative as being a democratic community
-Arguably more secure than closed source projects

-Closed source has ‘black boxes’ that we can’t understand as well
-Limited to a very small group
-Initiative to make money, for better or for worse

### A Brief History of Open Source

-Originated as freely licensing of patents across car companies, encouraging others to do the same
    -ARPANET was originally a DARPA project funded by the Department of Defense
    -This led to creating open standards against commercialization
    -Standardization of http and creating the backbone of the web
    -Has been massively scaled, and philosophy has stuck

### Common Misconceptions

open source software isn't lucrative for businesses

 <!-- find that charging users money for software services and support (rather than for the software itself) is more lucrative. This way, their software remains free of charge and they make money helping others install, use, and troubleshoot it. -->

--

### Proprietary Software

software  source code that cannot be modified by anyone but the person, team, or organization who created it and maintains exclusive control over it. This kind of software is frequently called "proprietary software" or "closed source" software, because its source code is the property of its original authors, who are the only ones legally allowed to copy or modify it. Microsoft Word and Adobe Photoshop are examples of proprietary software. In order to use proprietary software, computer users must agree (usually by signing a license displayed the first time they run this software) that they will not do anything with the software that the software's authors have not expressly permitted.
